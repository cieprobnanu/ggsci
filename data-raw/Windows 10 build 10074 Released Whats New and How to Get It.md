We hope you enjoy this new build of Windows 10 and let us know what you think!
  
One of the most noticeable changes in this build is the new Aero Glass effect on the Start menu and taskbar. This feature was popular in Windows 7 and was removed in Windows 8. Many users have requested its return, and Microsoft has listened. The transparency level can be adjusted in the Personalization settings.
 
Another change is the new Live Tile animation for the Start menu. The tiles now flip and slide in a more fluid and natural way. This makes the Start menu more lively and dynamic. You can also resize the Start menu by dragging its edges, or switch to a full screen mode by clicking the expand button on the top right corner.
 
This build also includes some improvements to the Continuum feature, which allows you to switch between desktop and tablet modes depending on your device and input method. For example, when you detach a keyboard from a 2-in-1 device, you will get a prompt to enter tablet mode. You can also swipe from the left edge of the screen to bring up Task View, or swipe from the right edge to access Action Center.
 
As for performance and stability, this build is faster and smoother than previous builds. It also fixes some bugs and issues that users have reported, such as problems with Cortana, Mail app, and File Explorer. However, there are still some known issues that Microsoft is working on, such as audio not working on some devices, or some apps crashing or not launching.
