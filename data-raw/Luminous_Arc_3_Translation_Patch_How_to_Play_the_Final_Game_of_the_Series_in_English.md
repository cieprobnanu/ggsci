However, Luminous Arc 3 was never officially localized in English, leaving many fans of the series disappointed and unable to enjoy the game. Fortunately, a dedicated fan translation team has recently released a full English patch for Luminous Arc 3, allowing anyone to play the game in English on their DS or emulator.
 
## What is the Luminous Arc 3 Translation Patch?
 
The Luminous Arc 3 Translation Patch is a fan-made project that aims to translate the entire game into English. The patch features fully-translated text, graphics, and online/multiplayer mode. The patch is based on machine translation tools (mostly DeepL and Google Translate) and some manual editing and proofreading. The translation team claims that there is still room for improvement in terms of quality, but they wanted to keep their promise of releasing the patch by the end of 2021.
 
## How to Apply the Luminous Arc 3 Translation Patch?
 
The Luminous Arc 3 Translation Patch is in xDelta format, which means you need a tool to apply it to the original Japanese ROM of the game. You can download the patch from [this link](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-luminous-arc-3-english-patch.605026/) and the tool for patching from [this link](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/). You also need to verify that the CRC-32 of the original Japanese ROM is 848822fd and the CRC-32 of the successfully patched English ROM is caec12b5.
 
Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to apply the patch:
 
1. Extract the patch file (Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0.zip) and the tool file (xdeltaUI.zip) to your preferred location.
2. Open xdelta UI.exe and click on "Open" next to "Patch". Browse to the folder where you extracted the patch file and select it.
3. Click on "Open" next to "Source File". Browse to the folder where you have your original Japanese ROM of Luminous Arc 3 and select it.
4. Click on "Open" next to "Output File". Choose a name and location for your patched ROM file.
5. Click on "Apply Patch" and wait for the process to finish.
6. Enjoy playing Luminous Arc 3 in English!

## How to Play Luminous Arc 3 Online/Multiplayer Mode?
 
Luminous Arc 3 has an online/multiplayer mode that allows you to battle with other players or cooperate with them in quests. The translation patch also covers this mode, but you need to configure your DS or emulator with Wiimmfi Network, a service that allows you to play online games that were discontinued by Nintendo. You can find a detailed guide on how to do this [here](https://luminousarc.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer).
 
## Conclusion
 
Luminous Arc 3 is a great game that deserves to be played by more people. Thanks to the hard work of the fan translation team, you can now enjoy this game in English on your DS or emulator. If you are a fan of tactical RPGs, anime-style graphics, and engaging stories, you should definitely give Luminous Arc 3 a try.
